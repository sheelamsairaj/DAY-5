# 💻 Cyber Security Internship: Task 5 - Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

## 🎯 Task Objective

The primary objective of this task was to capture and analyze live network traffic using the open-source packet analyzer **Wireshark**. The goal was to identify and characterize basic network protocols, understand how traffic flows, and use fundamental protocol analysis techniques for network troubleshooting.

## 🛠️ Execution and Setup

| Component | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tool Used** | Wireshark v4.2.0 |
| **Interface** | Wi-Fi (e.g., Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC) |
| **Traffic Generation** | Traffic was generated by performing the following actions while Wireshark was actively capturing: |
| | 1. Browsing the website `example.com`. |
| | 2. Performing a DNS lookup (`nslookup google.com`). |
| | 3. Pinging Google's public DNS server (`ping 8.8.8.8`). |
| **Deliverable** | The raw capture file is included in this repository (`traffic_capture.pcap`). |

## 🔍 Protocol Analysis and Findings

The following protocols were identified and analyzed by applying specific **Display Filters** within Wireshark (e.g., `http`, `dns`, `tcp`, `icmp`).

### 1. **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**
* **Purpose:** Provides **reliable, ordered, and error-checked** delivery of a stream of bytes between applications. It is the foundation for most internet applications.
* **Observation:** Observed the **three-way handshake** (`SYN`, `SYN-ACK`, `ACK`) used to establish a connection before the HTTP requests were sent. 

### 2. **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**
* **Purpose:** Provides a **connectionless** service that emphasizes speed over reliability, commonly used for DNS and streaming.
* **Observation:** Observed UDP traffic used by **DNS queries**, where speed is critical and a lost packet is easily re-requested.

### 3. **Domain Name System (DNS)**
* **Purpose:** Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `google.com`) into numerical IP addresses.
* **Observation:** Captured the DNS **Query** (a UDP packet) and the subsequent **Response** providing the IP address for the requested domain.

### 4. **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**
* **Purpose:** The standard protocol for transferring web pages and data between a web server and a client (web browser).
* **Observation:** Captured cleartext $\text{GET}$ requests for the website visited, including the requested resource path and the host header.

### 5. **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**
* **Purpose:** Used by network devices to send error messages and operational information, such as when a requested service is unavailable or a host or router cannot be reached.
* **Observation:** Captured the **Echo Request** and **Echo Reply** packets generated by the `ping` command, confirming the host reachability.

## ❓ Interview Questions (Learnings Summary)

### 1. What is Wireshark used for?
Wireshark is used for **packet sniffing/network protocol analysis**. It captures, filters, and inspects data packets flowing over a network, making it essential for network troubleshooting, development, and security auditing.

### 2. What is a packet filter?
A packet filter is a rule (syntax) applied to capture only a subset of network traffic. For example, the **Capture Filter** (`port 80`) restricts which packets are saved to the $\text{.pcap}$ file, while a **Display Filter** (`http or dns`) only changes which packets are *viewable* from the existing $\text{.pcap}$ file.

### 3. How to filter packets in Wireshark?
Packets are filtered using **Display Filters** in the filter bar at the top. Examples of filters used:
* `tcp.port == 80`: Shows only TCP traffic on port 80 (HTTP).
* `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1`: Shows all traffic to or from a specific IP address.
* `dns`: Shows only DNS traffic.

### 4. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
| Feature | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) | UDP (User Datagram Protocol) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reliability** | **High** (Guaranteed delivery, error checking, retransmission). | **Low** (Best-effort delivery, no guarantee). |
| **Connection** | **Connection-Oriented** (Uses the 3-way handshake). | **Connectionless** (Sends data immediately). |
| **Use Case** | Web browsing (HTTP/S), Email (SMTP), File Transfer (FTP). | DNS queries, Video Streaming, VoIP, Gaming. |

### 5. What is a Discovery Protocol?
Discovery protocols (like ARP, CDP, or LLDP) are used to map devices, determine device capabilities, and find services on a local network. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**, for example, discovers the MAC address associated with a given IP address on the local segment.

### 6. How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?
Packet capture is essential for troubleshooting by allowing an analyst to see the data at the wire level. It helps in:
* Diagnosing **intermittent connectivity** or packet loss.
* Identifying slow application response times (high **latency**).
* Pinpointing security issues like unauthorized connections or malware.
* Verifying firewall/routing rules by seeing where traffic is being dropped.

### 7. What are protocol ports?
Protocol ports (or logical ports) are 16-bit numbers (0-65535) used by the transport layer (**TCP** and **UDP**) to identify which application or service a packet belongs to on a host machine. Common examples are **80 (HTTP)**, **443 (HTTPS)**, and **53 (DNS)**.

### 8. Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?
**Yes, but only if** the analyst possesses the necessary encryption keys (such as the private key of the server or the pre-master secret log file for TLS sessions). Without the keys, Wireshark can only see the encrypted packets, not the plaintext contents.

## 🚀 Conclusion

Completing this task provided valuable hands-on experience in using Wireshark for real-time network protocol analysis. The capture clearly demonstrated the functional differences between connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP) traffic, and the roles of application-layer protocols like HTTP and DNS.
